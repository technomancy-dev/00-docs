## Download Pro

After you purchase 00 pro you will recieve an email with an license key.

You can use that key and download a `tar` of the pro docker container with the following command. (Make sure to replace `YOUR-LICENSE-KEY`)

```
curl -SLOG https://get.keygen.sh/technomancy-dev/0.0.2/double-zero-pro.tar.gz \
  -d 'auth=license:YOUR-LICENSE-KEY'
```
Use `double-zero-pro-arm.tar.gz` if you need to run on arm64.

You can then use `docker load < double-zero-pro.tar.gz` to turn the tar into a normal docker container.

Running `docker image ls` after should reveal a `technomancy/double-zero-pro` container. That can be hosted wherever you host docker containers.

All the deployment steps are the same as the [open source project] (https://github.com/technomancy-dev/00)

## Notes on upgrading.

First, there is no script to migrate the databse. I suggest making a backup if you care to keep the data and then starting fresh.

If you need it migrated please reach out, as I am working on migration scipts.

Also a new set of resources has been added to SST to handle recieving unsubscribe emails. So you will need to run SST again.

Please pull the latest version from github to run it. This will require you set an `UNSUBSCRIBE_EMAIL` to an email that is tied to an identity you added to SES (like the EMAIL_IDENTITY variable you set)

I use `UNSUBSCRIBE_EMAIL="unsubscribe@unsubscribe.double-zero.com"` and my email identitity is `"EMAIL_IDENTITY="double-zero.com"`

You will also need to set an `MX` record for that domain to allow AWS to recieve email. It will be the subdomain you use for your `UNSUBSCRIBE_EMAIL` as the host with the value being `inbound-smtp.region.amazonaws.com` where `region` is replaced with the AWS region you want to recieve mail from like `us-east-1`.
