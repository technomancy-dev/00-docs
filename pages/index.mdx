I encourage you to follow the in depth getting started guide linked below, but this page provides a tldr; answer to how hard is getting started.

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/technomancy-dev/00)
`git clone git@github.com:technomancy-dev/00.git` <br/>
2. Create a .env file with the following variables.
```
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_REGION= # Ex: us-east-1
SQS_URL=  # Ex: https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/${id}
SYSTEM_EMAIL= # For sending stuff like password resets. Ex: test@example.com should be able to send from SES.
SECRET_KEY_BASE= # A long secret. at least 64 characters. Can be made with mix phx.gen.secret or however you generate safe keys.
DATABASE_PATH= # Path to SQLite database Ex: 00.db
PHX_HOST= #  URL or IP of where this service is running. Ex: example.com
# 
# Needed with Pro
# 
UNSUBSCRIBE_EMAIL= # Some email that your email identity can use to recieve unsubscribe emails.

```
3. run `sst deploy` with your .env loaded (this will create the SNS -> SQS pipeline needed) <br/>


4. Run the docker container

`docker run -it --env-file .env -p 4000:4000 "liltechnomancer/double-zero"`

5. Send an email:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:4000/api/emails \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <GENERATE A TOKEN IN SETTINGS>' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "markdown": "<h1>Boogers</h1>",
  "subject": "Hark, who goes there?",
  "from": "\"Levi ðŸ‘»\" <levi@double-zero.cloud>",
  "to": "success@simulator.amazonses.com"
}'
```
