# Use SST to help people set up the project. 

## Context

People have difficulty with the AWS steps, as it is a terrible dashboard and many steps. Set up the correct SES setup for 00 is possible with SST. 

## Decision

SST was added as an optional step when setting up the project. Hopfully some of this can eventually be rolled into the UI itself. 

## Consequences

Now the happy installation path relies on SST and people have to install it.
