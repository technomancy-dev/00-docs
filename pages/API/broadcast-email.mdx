Broadcasts support `{{ liquid_style }}` templates for both HTML and Markdown.

Variables can be passed with the request, attached to recipients, or come from stored contact information. Currently the variables stored on contacts are `first_name` and `last_name`.

This allows for templates like

```
# Hello {{ first_name }},

I am emailing your about your car's extended warranty.
I see you drive a {{ car.year }}, {{ car.make }} {{ car.model }}
```

### `from` (required)

**type:** `string`

### `recipients` (required)

**type:** `string[] | List[] | Email[]` 




Accepts an array of email addresses, or simple objects `list` or `email` defined by the type field.

#### List

**type:** `{ type: "list", name?: string, id?: string }`

List takes either a `name` which is the name of the list, or `id` which is it's UUID.
```json
{
  type: "list",
  name: "Some List"
}
// OR

  type: "list",
  id: "12345"
}
```

#### Email

**type:** `{ type: "email", name: email, [key: string]: any; }`
 
Email simply requires an `email` field. Anything else you add to this object will be fed into the template variables.

  email: "test@example.com"
}
```
